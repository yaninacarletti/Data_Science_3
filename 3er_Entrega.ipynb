Tomar como train los datos hasta el 1 de marzo de 2021. Desde el 1ro de marzo en adelante, reservar para test.\n","- Desarrollar un recomendador. El recomendador debe ser capaz de generar recomendaciones para TODOS los usuarios (incluyendo los cold start que no tengan visualizaciones en el set de train). Generar 20 recomendaciones por usuario.\n","- Las recomendaciones tienen que ser para cada account_id y hay que recomendar content_id (NO asset_id). Pueden encontrar esto en el repositorio de la competencia.\n","- Los contenidos que recomienden, no tienen que haber sido vistos previamente por los usuarios.\n","- Evaluarlo con MAP.\n","\n","### Recomendaciones:\n","- En este caso no tenemos ratings explícitos, deben generar ustedes estos ratings mediante algún criterio. Lo más simple podría ser utilizar ratings binarios.\n","- La columna **end_vod_date**: \"fecha de finalización de la disponibilidad del activo en la plataforma\" puede llegar a serles útil. ¿Tiene sentido recomendar algo que no va a estar disponible en el set de test?.\n","\n","\n","### Datos:\n","- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QjbqJvU0PTClEhReOyzr96BS-HpyyUKT/view?usp=sharing\n","-
